            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>
             Meal Miracle started with a group of passionate individuals who recognized the pressing issue of food insecurity in our community. Motivated by a shared desire to make a difference, we came together to form this initiative. Our journey began with a commitment to redistributing surplus food to those who need it most.
            </p>
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
            We work closely with local businesses, farmers, and food producers to rescue surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. Our dedicated team of volunteers ensures that this rescued food reaches community centers, shelters, and individuals facing hunger. Through strategic partnerships and grassroots efforts, we aim to create a sustainable and efficient system for food distribution.
